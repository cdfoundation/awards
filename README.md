# üèÜ CDF Community Awards
The Continuous Delivery Foundation recognizes community members, developers, and advocates that work hard to make this community great and push for Continuous Delivery advancements.

We traditionally have the following awards, awarded at our annual cdCon event:
* **Continuous Enthusiast** (New in 2022): The special award for the community contributors. When you think of the CDF community, this person should be on the shortlist, because they're everywhere!
* **Top CDF Ambassador**: A champion for the continuous delivery space. This individual helps spread awareness of the CDF and its projects. The CDF Ambassador leverages multiple platforms, both online as well as speaking engagements, driving interest and excitement around the ecosystem.
* **Top CDF Contributor**: Recognizes excellence of technical contributions to the CDF and its projects. This individual commits key pieces to projects and, more importantly, contributes in a way that benefits the project neutrally as a whole.
* **Top Doc(umenter)** (New in 2022): This award recognizes excellence in documentation contributions to the CDF and its projects. Outstanding technical documentation is one of the best ways projects can lower the barrier to contribution.
* **Top CDF End User**: The special award for the CDF End User Companies. This company embodies Continuous Delivery in the enterprise and strives to improve its processes. Their team members also drive important open conversations with other companies and CDF committees.

## Project Awards
Each project conducts its own selection process for their Most Valuable Contributor Award. Jenkins has three awards due to its graduated status and project award history.
